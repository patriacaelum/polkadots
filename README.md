# Polkadots

These are my configuration dot files for my [Arch Linux][archlinux] system.

## Installation

The required programs for my config are:

- [feh][feh] to control the desktop background. I use a horizontal and vertical
  monitor, and there is a [python script](/.config/i3/wallpaper.py) that changes
  the background every hour.
- [iA Writer Duospace Font][ia-fonts] is a [duospaced font][duospace], which,
  for me, makes writing and reading much easier.
- [kitty][kitty] is my terminal emulator of choice with lots of great features
  like in-terminal image viewing and hyperlinks.
- [polybar][polybar] is a simple and customizable status bar.
- [rofi][rofi] is an application launcher.
- [fontawesome][fontawesome] is a font with icons.
- [i3][i3wm] is a tiling window manager. Switching from KDE Plasma, I found
  that I don't _really_ need to minimize windows, and working mostly from the
  keyboard is faster.
- [python][python] is used to switch backgrounds. I am also mostly a python
  developer.
  - [pillow][python-pillow] is an python imaging library, and required to format
    the background images.
- [zsh][zsh] is my shell of choice.
  - [p10k][zsh-p10k] is a very nice zsh theme.
  - [zsh-autosuggestions][zsh-autosuggestions]
  - [zsh-history-substring-search][zsh-history-substring-search]
  - [zsh-syntax-highlighting][zsh-syntax-highlighting]
